## Introduction

This is the free version of 'Azure Kinect Examples for Unity' package. It works with Azure Kinect (aka Kinect4Azure, K4A) sensor only and requires at least Unity 2019.1f2. 
So far it contains two demo scenes:
* BasicColorDepthDemo - shows the basic sensor streams - color and depth
* VfxPointCloudDemo - displays the point cloud of the environment.

I hope you can also get the feeling what the full package looks like. Enjoy!

## How to Run the Demo Scenes
